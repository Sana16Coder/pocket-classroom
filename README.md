🏛 Pocket Classroom — Offline Micro-Lessons
Pocket Classroom is a lightweight, browser-based study tool that lets students build small “learning capsules” such as notes, flashcards, and short quizzes. Everything runs client-side no server is required and progress is stored locally so it also works offline. Capsules can be exported and shared via JSON files.

🧰 Technologies Used
HTML5 for the page structure
CSS3 + Bootstrap 5 for layout and responsive design
Vanilla JavaScript (ES modules) for the interactive behavior
LocalStorage to save and load capsules and user progress
